# PHPMachinist: Testing Object Factory

## What???!??!
A Slightly less annoying way of creating database fixtures for PHP testing. It borrows heavily from
several projects:
 * https://github.com/chriskite/phactory
 * https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_girl
 * https://github.com/ccollins/milkman
 * https://github.com/notahat/machinist
They're totally awesome. Just either in the wrong language, or didn't quite do what I wanted.
